Random Number Generator Website
This is a simple website created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that generates random numbers within a range specified by the user. After entering their name and desired range, the website generates a random number and displays it. It is a good starting point for beginners learning web development and programming. Future improvements could include adding more features, making it responsive for mobile devices, and improving the visual design.
